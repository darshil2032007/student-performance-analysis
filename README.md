# 📊 Student Performance Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a student examination dataset to uncover trends, performance patterns, and relationships between academic scores and influencing factors.

The analysis evaluates student achievement across **Mathematics, Reading, and Writing**, while examining the impact of demographic and socio-academic variables.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Assess overall student performance across subjects  
- Compare subject-wise average scores  
- Analyze score distributions and variability  
- Investigate influencing factors:
  - Gender
  - Test Preparation Course
  - Parental Level of Education
  - Race/Ethnicity
- Perform correlation analysis  
- Engineer performance metrics (Total & Average Score)

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
